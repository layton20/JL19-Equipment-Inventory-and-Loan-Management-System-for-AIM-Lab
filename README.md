# JL19 Equipment Inventory & Loan Management System for AIM-Lab

## Description
This repository will hold my final year project. The web project will be developed with ASP.NET.
The project contains the entire project all bundled up, and I have chosen to not split project up into APIs and a front-facing application, solely due to the context that having multiple APIs set up is costly during development (I do have localhost) but I like to have them published for testing in main/production. 

The application will only be used by the client, literally. I doubt there'd be a need to split the project up into separate applications/APIs because no external parties would use them (any time soon ðŸ˜‰). For the time being, I've chosen to bundle them up. If there'd be a need in the future, it shouldn't be too difficult to split the application up because the project is relatively small.

## Supervisor

## Project brief
The Aston Interactive Media (AIM) Lab is home to a variety of interesting technology, much of which can be signed out on loan by research staff/students working within the lab. This project will design and build - with the AIM Lab Director as the client - an online inventory system that will keep track of equipment - spec, purchase date, warranty expiration, the date for evergreening, etc. - and will also encompass a sign-out mechanism under the control of the AIM Lab Director such that staff and students can sign-out, under agreed terms and conditions, equipment from the lab and thus the whereabouts of any given item be carefully monitored. Co-requisite modules: CS3410; CS3160
